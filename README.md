# AI 570 Discussion 4
### czu5008@psu.edu

This project was the basis for my AI 570 discussion 4 post. It demonstrates and MVP-level
multi-input neural network that performs binary classification on a combination of 
textual descriptions of clothing products and images of those same products. The 
classification determines if the product is an item of footwear, or not.

## Files
* __discussion-4.ipynb__: main code for the project
* __requirements.txt__: python pip dependencies
* __data__: directory containing the clothing data from kaggle
